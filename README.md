> Zhang, S. and Chen, Y. (2023). A Note on Ising Network Analysis with Missing Data.

## Files

The following files are provided:

- depend_funcs.py: This Python script is the source file containing utility functions that are essential to the processes of model fitting and data manipulation.

- simulation1.py: A Python script designed for the six-node simulation example. It runs the model and produces results based on predefined parameters.
- simulation2.py: This Python script is developed for a more complex, fifteen-node simulation example, providing further insight into the model's performance.
- real_data_Ising.py: This Python script is used for analysing the NESARC dataset utilizing the method proposed in our study. It illustrates how the method is applied to real-world data.

### Code Format

The provided code scripts are written in Python. Users should ensure they have an appropriate Python environment set up to run the scripts.
